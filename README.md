# Module-1-Project---Trip-Planner
This is the very basic project when you start learning Java. 
For this project, you are going to write a program that asks the user for some information about an international trip they are taking. Based on that information you will need to do some conversions, using the correct data types, to tell them some information to help them plan their trip.
